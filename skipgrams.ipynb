And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such as\\ncertain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all, \\nbut mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses.  \\n\\nAnd I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that\\nscience amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.

       " \"\\nWhether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window, or\\ndreaming, or having a fantasy,  or watching an apple fall (Newton), or\\nsitting in a bath (Archimedes) ... it is ultimately the result of a lot of\\nintense scientific thinking done beforehand.  Letting one's mind roam\\nfreely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of coming\\nup with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis\\nof the problem first.  \\n\\nScientific intuition is not something one is born with.  It is something\\nthat one learns.  Maybe we don't understand completely how it is learned,\\nbut training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the \\nkey elements in developing it.  \\n\\nInformal exploration is also often an important element in finding new\\nscientific ideas.  One thinks, for instance, of Darwin's naturalistic\\nstudies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for the \\ntheory of evolution.  \\n\\nThis is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes\\nempirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal\\nexploration as important scientific work.  I agree that mere speculation\\ndoes not deserve to be called science.  I also think that mere empirical\\nstudies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very\\npoor kind of science.  \\n\\n\\nI don't think that science should be defined in a way that some of the\\nactivities that lead to really important science --- namely thinking and\\ninformal exploration --- are not recognized as scientific work.  \\n\\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\n",

Dr. Noordewier has \\nappointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and \\nhas extensive experience in basic biological research in addition \\nto his current work in computational biology.\\n\\n12:00-2:45pm \"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for \\n Biologists\"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)\\n\\nAn overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be \\npresented, as it relates to actual and potential biological \\napplications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming \\nlanguages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as \\nselected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge \\nrepresentation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended \\naudience includes biologists with some computational background, \\nbut no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. \\nLathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has \\nworked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to \\nbiological problems in both academia and industry.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory \\n in Biological Sequence Analysis\" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos \\n National Laboratory) \\n\\nThis tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of \\nintelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine \\nlearning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely \\ninterrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical \\nneural networks to elicit both specific signals and general \\ncharacteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such \\napproaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic \\nviews of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical \\nDivision at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such \\ntechniques in this domain.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming\" \\n Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)\\n\\nThe genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly \\nnon-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally \\ninspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both \\nthe biological motivations, and the actual implementation and \\ncharacteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an \\nextension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size \\nand shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will \\nalso be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to \\nbiological applications, and to identifying resources and software \\nthat will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, \\na Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught \\nthis subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in \\nthe field.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis\" \\n Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) \\n & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)\\n\\nApproaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies \\nare increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of \\ntools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic \\npattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of \\ngenetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the \\nidentification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes \\nin sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and \\nfunctional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty \\nappointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, \\nrepresents the branch of this field that considers higher-order \\nsyntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski \\nhas studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area \\nof word-based analyses.\\n\\n                      REGISTRATION FORM\\nMail, with check made out to \"ISMB-93\", to:\\n\\n               ISMB Conference, c/o J.

Others (like me) are more\\n     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.\\n\\n  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear\\n     that these things will itch for months.\\n\\n  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of\\n     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,\\n     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could\\n     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC\\'s special\\n     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is\\n     required to get it.\\n\\n  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old\\n     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn\\'t work.  I recall\\n     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers\\n     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I\\n     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some\\n     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.\\n\\n  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.\\n     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally\\n     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is\\n     another preparation called \"Chig Away\" that is a combination of\\n     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was\\n     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In\\n     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get\\n     up on weekends since I literally can\\'t go outside where we\\n     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They\\n     apparently don\\'t like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur\\n     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)\\n\\n  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget\\n     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment\\n     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone\\n     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine\\n     (relieves the itch).  I won\\'t tell you all the things I\\'ve tried.\\n     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this\\n     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think\\n     it gains nothing).\\n\\n  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved\\n     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery\\n     as well.\\n\\nDoctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban\\ndoctors apparently don\\'t encounter them much.  And the rural doctors\\nseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I\\nsuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers\\nwould make a *lot* of money.',\n",
       " '\\nSome will, and others will steer with their tuchuses. I don\\'t know how much\\nthe teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the\\ntuchus steerers. I was one, I guess that I always steered a bicycle that way,\\nand I only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding *after* the course.\\nI could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem, but I only\\nstarted using it in my normal riding when I decided that my turning at speed\\n(off-ramps and the like) was a lot more difficult that it should have been.\\nI knew how it works (although that\\'s currently up for debate) definitely knew\\n*that* it works, as I could do it in swerves, but only figured it out later\\nin my normal riding. Just a data point. I think that it\\'s not a bad idea to\\nbring the idea up, but it\\'s best to let everyone tuchus-steer for the first\\nlesson or two, so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry\\nabout proper handlebar technique.\\n\\n\\nI have. In our beginner course we had passenger training. Sometime during\\nthe lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike, and the student\\nwould take him for a ride. If the student did not give the instructor the\\n\"you are a sack of potatoes\" passenger speech, the instructor would steer\\nthe bike and make a general nuisance of himself. It was amusing to watch,\\nI\\'m just happy that it didn\\'t happen to me.',\n",

       " 'INTENSIVE JAPANESE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THIS SUMMER\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n\\nThe University of Pittsburgh is offering two intensive Japanese language\\ncourses this summer.  Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and \\nIntensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses \\neach equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin \\nJune 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours \\nper day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.  \\nFellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact \\nSteven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology\\nManagement Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or\\naddress below.  \\nALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO \\nUNIVERSITY STUDENTS.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n#######################################################################\\n#################   New Program Announcement   ########################\\n#######################################################################\\n\\n\\n            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\\n\\nThe Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new\\nprogram jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon \\nUniversity.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \\ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \\nJanuary 1994.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \\nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \\nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM DESIGN\\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \\ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\\n\\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\\nrelatively short time.\\n\\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \\nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \\nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \\nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\\n\\n\\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \\nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\\n\\n\\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\\n\\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\\n\\nSTEVEN BRENER\\t\\t\\t\\tSUSIE BROWN\\nJSTMP\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIA\\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\\t\\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle\\t\\t\\tTelephone: (412) 268-7806\\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\\t\\t\\tFAX:\\t   (412) 268-8163\\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414\\t\\t\\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199\\t\\t\\n\\n############################################################################\\n############################################################################ \\n\\n\\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\\nmail.

The 1986 Safe\\nDrinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to either\\nfilter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use\\nfrom pollution,\" Olson continued.  Some systems are moving\\ntowards eventually implementing filtration systems but are\\nexpected to miss the law\\'s deadline.\\n   Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already\\na reality in other cities.  A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surface\\nwater systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent\\nof raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism\\ncryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasite\\ncalled giardia.\\n   Adding to the level of concern, a General Accounting Office\\nstudy released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee\\nChairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the\\nnation\\'s system for conducting and following through on sanitary\\nsurveys of water systems.\\n   \"This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions\\nof Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be\\nassured that their water is safe to drink.  We must immediately\\nput into place programs to protect water sources from\\ncontamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipment\\nmust be installed to protect the public,\" Olson noted.  \"The time\\nhas come for many of the nation\\'s water utilities to stop\\ndragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from\\ncontamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs\\nneeded to assure their water is safe to drink.\"\\n   NRDC is a national non-profit environmental advocacy organization.\\n\\n   Systems EPA Indicates Require Filtration and Do Not Adequately\\nProtect Watersheds\\n\\n CONNECTICUT\\n\\n Bridgeport            Bridgeport Hydraulic Co.\\n\\n MASSACHUSETTS\\n Boston                H2O Resource Author (MWRA)\\n Medford               MWRA-Medford Water Dept\\n Melrose               MWRA-Melrose Water Dept\\n Hilton                MWRA-Hilton Water Dept\\n Needham               MWRA-Needham Water Division\\n Newtoncenter          MWRA-Newton Water Dept.\\n Marblehead            MWRA-Marblehead Water Dept\\n Quincy                MWRA-Quincy Water Dept\\n Norwood               MWRA-Norwood Water Dept\\n Framingham            MWRA-Framingham Water Div\\n Cambridge             MWRA-Cambridge Water Dept\\n Canton                MWRA-Canton Water Div-DPW\\n Chelsea               MWRA-Chelsea Water Dept\\n Everett               MWRA-Everett Water Dept\\n Lexington             MWRA-201 Bedford (PUO WRKS)\\n Lynn                  MWRA-Lynn Water & Sewer Co\\n Malden                MWRA-Malden Water Division\\n Revere                MWRA-Revere Water Dept\\n Woburn                MWRA-Woburn Water Dept\\n Swampscott            MWRA-Swampscott Water Dept\\n Saugus                MWRA-Saugus Water Dept\\n Somerville            MWRA-Somerville Water Dept\\n Stoneman              MWRA-Stoneman Water Dept\\n Brookline             MWRA-Brookline Water Dept\\n Wakefield             MWRA-Same as Above\\n Waltham               MWRA-Waltham Water Division\\n Watertown             MWRA-Watertown Water Division\\n Weston                MWRA-Weston Water Dept\\n Dedham                MWRA-Dedham-Westwood District\\n Winchester            MWRA-Winchester Water & Sewer\\n Winthrop              MWRA-Winthrop Water Dept\\n Boston                MWRA-Boston Water & Sewer Co\\n S.

Was\\nDS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon\\'s Head on the front\\nDS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?\\n\\nNo. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\\nFriz\\'s famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\\n\\n\\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\\\=@=/\\n\\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\\n\\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\\n\\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\\nengineering fixes was that until the engine\\'s oil pressure came up to\\nnormal, the engine\\'s valve timing would be more or less random,\\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\\nuses an electric oil pump.

Well, first, it's a good idea to\\nassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a\\ngame, and not out of overt hostility.

This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\\n-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\\nroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\\nnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\\nhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\\nthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\\nlarger the dog, the greater your anger.\\n\\nDogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he\\nare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he\\nis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.\\n\\nMost dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory\\nwhere there is at least a home advantage.

       " \"\\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\\n\\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\\n\\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\\nI also passed my road test.\\n\\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\\na car and been killed.\\n\\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\\nas I did.\\n\\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\\nyou're ready to use it.\\n\\n\\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\\n\\n\\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\\nmore expensive.\\n\\n\\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\\n\\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\",\n",

[...edited for brevity...]\\n\\n\\t\"Chances are good that if you watched \\'60 Minutes\\' last November\\n\\t3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In\\n\\tthe segment entitled \\'No MSG,\\' for instance, show host Ed Bradley\\n\\tmakes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them\\n\\t(\\'millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently\\n\\tsick\\'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven\\n\\tpersonal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the\\n\\tsubstance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive \\n\\tthose studies are.\\n\\n\\tConsider his making reference at the beginning of the program to\\n\\ta study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order\\n\\tto back up his comment that there is \\'a lot of evidence\\' that MSG,\\n\\ta flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as\\n\\tin many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT\\n\\tmake reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on\\n\\thumans but on rabbits.\\n\\n\\tOne of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist\\n\\tPatricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that\\n\\ta small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get \\n\\theadaches from it.  \\'But,\\' she explains, \\'the show probably \\n\\toveremphasized the extent of the problem.\\'\\n\\n\\tA second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor\\n\\tat the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley\\n\\tremarks, \\'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory\\n\\tanimals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters\\' because\\n\\tit poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney\\'s\\n\\tresearch with lab animals does not \\'show\\' anything about human\\n\\tyoungsters.\\n\\n\\tIn fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney\\'s \\n\\texperiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected\\n\\textremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing \\n\\ttheir digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly,\\n\\tand when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance\\n\\tto very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither\\n\\tof those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG \\n\\twith food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by\\n\\tenzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little\\n\\treaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human\\n\\tblood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations\\n\\tfound in Dr. Olney\\'s lab animals.....\\n\\n\\tThe World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of\\n\\tthat fact.  And so does the European Communities\\' Scientific\\n\\tCommittee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies,\\n\\thave concluded that MSG is safe.\\n\\n\\tTheir determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never\\n\\tbeen proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed\\n\\tto it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a\\n\\tburning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe\\n\\tof clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently\\n\\texonerated the much-maligned substance.\\n\\n\\tThat\\'s quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of\\n\\tmonosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever\\n\\twe eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one\\n\\tof the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken\\n\\tdown into glutamate during digestion.\\n\\n\\tIt\\'s a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the\\n\\tmost abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes\\n\\tup about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in\\n\\tmilk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.\\n\\n\\tThat doesn\\'t mean it\\'s entirely unimaginable that a small number\\n\\tof people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore\\n\\tsensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international\\n\\tprofessional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus\\n\\treached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large.\"\\n',\n",

Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \\ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \\nJanuary 1994.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \\nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \\nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM DESIGN\\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \\ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\\n\\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\\nrelatively short time.\\n\\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \\nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \\nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \\nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\\n\\n\\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \\nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\\nand participate in the management of technology.

Books have been written on that! But in regard to\\nAeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs.\\nIf you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero\\ndimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching\\nthe 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it.\\nHaving my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very\\nconcerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in\\nprotection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I\\nthink the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a\\ndifference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go\\nsomewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket)\\nyou can just detach and stow the pants. \\n\\nOne thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for\\nmany women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and\\npetite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better. \\n\\nAnother recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them.

       " 'I am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway.\\n\\n About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes\\n under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement\\n of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of\\n the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced\\n the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor \\n suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.\\n\\n While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being \\n manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently\\n increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (\\n palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part\\n the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had\\n been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the\\n pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is \\n persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3\\n and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides\\n minor reductions in pain and is only short term.  \\n\\n My questions are: \\n\\n     Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the\\n     levels of pain?\\n\\n     Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?\\n\\n     Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?\\n\\n\\n  Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.\\n  \\n  \\n  Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.\\n\\n  If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup\\n  that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated.\\n   \\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

However, expressing\\n    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\\n    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\\n    exceed their technical skills.\\n\\n    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\\n    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\\n    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\\n    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\\n    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\\n    representions, a confounded user asks: \"What does it all mean?\"\\n\\n    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\\n    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\\n    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\\n    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\\n    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\\n    composing imagery for understanding.\\n\\n    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\\n    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\\n    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\\n    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\\n    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\\n    computer graphics context.\\n\\n\\n    FEATURED SPEAKERS INCLUDE:\\n\\n        Psychology/Perception:\\n            Marc De May, University of Ghent\\n            Beverly J.

       " 'For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think\\nabout airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from \\nDennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my \\'85 FJ1100. They are rated\\nat 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to\\nthe relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay\\npins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used\\na crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.\\n\\tI installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front\\nfairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube\\nframe used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to\\ndo this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two\\nvertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing\\nfollows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.\\nThe compressor is about 2\" in diameter and about 5\" long.\\n\\tThe relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small\\nso there should be plenty of good places for it.\\n\\tI found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to\\nmount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side\\njust in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the\\nhorns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where\\nthe gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough\\nroom to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice\\ncut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.\\n\\tThe short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out\\nabout an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look\\nclosely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight\\nahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).\\n\\tIf you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try\\nto explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them\\nfirst.\\n\\tHow do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound\\nmore like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.\\nI have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has\\nnot blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).\\n\\tI\\'ve repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though\\nthey know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping\\nthe pedestrians on the sidewalk.\\nThe bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to\\nthose stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)\\nand are relatively easy to install on the FJ.

He\\'s kept a record of the results, and for over \\n2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief\\nof allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his\\nprogram.\\n\\nIn my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic\\nsymptoms outlined in \\'The Yeast Connection\\' (I agree it is a poorly \\nwritten book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which\\nI never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage\\nof Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can\\nnow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I\\'m also\\n*greatly* improved in other areas as well.\\n\\nOf course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to\\nmolds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn\\'t take a rocket scientist to figure out that\\nif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a\\nnatural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you\\nwould have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various\\nsorts, and again, you don\\'t have to be a rocket scientist to realize that\\nsuch toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus\\nsince that\\'s the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000\\nquestion is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was\\nfrom over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the\\nstress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast\\ncolonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since\\ntesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to\\ntake an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively\\nsafe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there\\'s\\nno reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.\\n\\nBTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae\\ntoo deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You\\'ll find\\na lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.\\n\\nIn summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep\\nmedicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly\\nto the party line are academics who haven\\'t been in the trenches long enough\\nactually treating patients.

This disease is \\nuniversally and usually rapidly fatal.  After diagnosis in June 1992, the \\ntumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  The forum \\nmember checked extensively on Dr. Burzynki\\'s track record for this disease.  \\nHe spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from \\nglioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had \\naudited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive.  \\nAfter the forum member\\'s father began Dr. Burzynski\\'s treatment in \\nSeptember, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his \\noncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of \\nshrinkage or necrosis.\\n\\nThe patient\\'s oncologist, although telling him he would probably not live \\npast December 1992, was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynski\\'s \\ntreatment.  Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr. Burzynski\\'s \\ntreatment, she\\'s since changed her attitude toward continuing these \\ntreatments, saying \"if it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it.\"\\n\\nDr. Burzynski is an M.D., Ph.D. with a research background who found a \\nprotein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, synthesized it, \\nand administers it to patients with certain cancer types.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\\n        2. X terminals\\n        3. NeXT\\n        4. Silicon Graphics\\n        5. IBM RS/6000\\n\\t6. Other stuff\\n\\n    1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\\n\\n\\tIf you\\'ve got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard\\n\\t(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you\\'re going to have a hard time finding\\n\\ta vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation\\n\\truns the X window system, you\\'re in luck.  You can buy a cheap used\\n\\tPC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable\\n\\tto your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read\\n\\tthe serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.\\n\\n\\tThe two main programs I\\'ve found to do this are KT and A2X.\\n\\n\\ta2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and\\n\\teven moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server\\n\\textension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your\\n\\tserver can do this, run \\'xdpyinfo\\' and see if any of these strings\\n\\tappear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn\\'t have this,\\n\\tyou may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,\\n\\tor bugging your vendor.\\n\\n\\tkt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.\\n\\tAnother program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven\\'t seen it.\\n\\n\\tBoth a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.\\n\\n    2. X terminals\\n\\n\\tAlso, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use\\n\\tPC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all\\n\\tset.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the\\n\\ttrouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add\\n\\textra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around\\n\\tfor the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.\\n\\n    3. NeXT\\n\\n\\tNeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop\\n\\tBus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they\\n\\twere cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of\\n\\tupgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!\\n\\n    4. Silicon Graphics\\n\\n\\tSilicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and\\n\\tbeyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don\\'t\\n\\tbelieve this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It\\'s not\\n\\tpossible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by\\n\\tupgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more\\n\\tdetails.\\n\\n    5. IBM RS/6000\\n\\n\\tIBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||\\n\\tUnfortunately, you can\\'t just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||\\n\\tcable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||\\n\\tsmaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||\\n\\tit or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||\\n\\tworks.  However, they don\\'t want me to redistribute it.  I\\'ve been  ||\\n\\ttold Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||\\n\\tanything new, please send me e-mail.\\t\\t\\t\\t    ||\\n    \\n    6. Other stuff\\n\\n\\tSome vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)\\n\\tsupport some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your\\n\\tqueries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can\\n\\tget sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either\\n\\tfrom the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in\\n\\tluck.  Contact the companies for more details.\\n\\n\\nApple Adjustable Keyboard\\n    Apple Computer, Inc.\\n    Sales offices all over the place.\\n\\n    Availability: February, 1993\\n    Price: $219\\n    Supports: Mac only\\n\\n    Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The\\n    keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate\\n    backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are\\n    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.\\n\\n    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.\\n    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.\\n\\n    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not\\n    directly attachable to the keyboard.\\n\\n    As soon as soda comes back up, I\\'ll have a detailed blurb from\\n    TidBITS available there.\\n\\n\\nFlexPro Keyboard\\n    Key Tronic\\n    Phone: 800-262-6006\\n    Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299\\n    Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops\\n\\n    Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)\\n    Price: $489 (?)\\n    Supports: PC only (highly likely)\\n\\n    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.

Then again, I'm not really sure what the right amount\\nof ordering is or should be.  Relative to the average British\\nneurologist, I suspect that I rather drastically over-order.\",\n",

In most of this thread, I have\\nbeen concerned with the difference between what is science and\\nwhat is not. \\n\\nLee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between\\nEinstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of\\ntheir thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a\\ngenius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts\\nare scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or\\nKorzybski as examples.  If you don\\'t like these, choose your\\nown.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre\\nphysicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and\\nthe mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the\\ncumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong.\\nBoth Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to\\ndo this.  \\n\\nLet me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked\\nto review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many\\nkinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is\\nthat the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of\\ncriticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either\\nnot important or not interesting.  The first difference is the\\none that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the\\none that Lee Lady seems to be discussing. \\n\\n\\nI have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered \\nscientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims,\\nnot just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect\\nthat traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work;\\nwhat it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the\\npresence of qi.\\n\\n\\nCertainly a \"theoretical structure that makes sense\" is the goal.\\nIn areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with\\nforming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Let\\'s face it: we cannot\\nalways wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything\\nclear for us.

       " '\\nGee!  Maybe I\\'ve misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something \\nI say can\\'t be all bad.  ;-)\\n\\nSeriously, I\\'m not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.  \\nI still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science \\nis mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your \\ncontention that nobody who doesn\\'t use methods deemed \"scientific\" \\ncan possibly know what\\'s true and what\\'s not.  \\n\\n\\nOkay, so let\\'s see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \\nof certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \\ncontrolled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \\nextent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \\ntreatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even \\nif uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that\\na treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for\\nfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support.\\nIn this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible\\nbut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are\\nqualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.\\n\\nSECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of \\nevidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  \\n\\n\\nI come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a\\nmathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and\\noccasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much\\nof the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as\\ninformal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years\\nnow I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to\\njust take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of\\nthe videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for\\nthe purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the\\nNLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from\\nsubjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of\\nscientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the\\n*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific\\ninvestigation.\\n\\nOver and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \"If this\\nhasn\\'t been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical\\nresearch then it can\\'t be of any interest to us.\"  \\n\\nTo me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \"There\\'ve got to\\nbe controlled studies\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast\\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.\\n\\nSimple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world\\'s most \\nimportant psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that \\nit doesn\\'t take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell \\nwhen someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple \\nvisualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that\\nit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is\\nuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially\\na variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral\\ntherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once\\n(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The\\nprocess doesn\\'t need to be repeated and the subject doesn\\'t need to\\npractice it over again at home.\\n\\nNow to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. \\n(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  \\nTake someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up \\nto a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 \\nminutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to \\nthe balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a \\nfew weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term \\nfollow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view \\neven a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, \\nthere are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best \\nof my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed \\nafter holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done\\nwith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast \\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th\\nfloor of my building and having a large balcony.)  \\n\\nThe folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\\nmake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study\\nwill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, \\nmany of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill \\nafford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because \\nthe whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they\\'re not part of the\\nscientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain \\nfrom scientific acceptance.) \\n\\nThe Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical \\npsychology establishment is still saying \"We don\\'t have any way of \\nknowing that it\\'s effective.\"  \\n\\nThese academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate \\nas anyone could want, of course, but they say  \"Why should I prove your \\ntheory?\"  and  \"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\"  \\nOne academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely \\nunscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn\\'t \\nbeen described in a scientific journal.  (It\\'s described in a number of \\nbooks and I\\'ve posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much \\ndetail as I\\'m capable of.)  \\n\\nActually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with \\nfavorable results), but it\\'s apparently not acceptable because it\\'s a\\ndoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.\\n\\nTo me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  \\nThis is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \"doctrinnaire\" \\nattitudes about science.  \\n\\nNow maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  \\nIf so, I apologize. \\n \\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

The reason is\\nthat deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as\\nhydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman\\nconstant, mumble).

Why should every organ in the body suddenly\\nbegin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the\\nheavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real\\nstory here.\\n\\nCome to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was\\nno longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.\\n\\nThe most detectable effect would be that the victim\\'s body fluids\\nwould literally be \"heavy\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and\\nheavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim\\'s weight will increase by\\nabout 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.

If I fail with these pipes, there are gonna\\nbe a whole lotta seriously pissed off bikers round here when they go\\nfor inspection.\\n\\n*&%^*$%*^*%*&\\n\\nBut hey, its a new experience! I have never really felt like a menace\\nto society before! I parked, dismounted and walked in to my building\\nwith a slight swagger to my step, and a narrow lidded look... I sensed\\nmy faculty colleagues unease with my new intimidating status...and\\nwomen's glances seemed to linger just a little longer....or perhaps\\nthat was my imagination.......*sigh*\\n\\nNow I need to install my new BUB pipes and single fire ignition....I\\nwonder how I will do after that!? \",\n",

In comparison, in \\nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \\ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \\ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \\nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. \\n     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \\nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \\nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \\n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \\n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \\nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \\nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \\nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \\nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \\nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \\nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \\ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). \\n     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \\nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \\nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \\noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \\nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency \\nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. \\n     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \\nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \\nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \\nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \\ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \\nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \\n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \\nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \\nrespectively). \\n     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \\nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \\nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \\nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \\n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \\nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). \\n     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \\nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \\nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \\nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \\nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \\n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \\n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \\nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \\n\\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE \\nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health.

Surveillance and Information Systems Br, \\nDiv of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for \\nPrevention Svcs, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 \\nmay represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more \\ncomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH \\nsurveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \\ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \\nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \\nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \\nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \\ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. \\n     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \\nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \\nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \\n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \\ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \\nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \\npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \\n-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \\ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \\nand gang affiliation. \\n     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \\nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \\n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \\ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \\ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \\nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. \\n     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \\ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting \\npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \\nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \\nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \\nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \\nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \\nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \\ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \\nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \\nand health-care providers. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \\nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \\nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \\nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \\nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \\ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \\noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \\nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \\naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \\nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \\nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \\nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \\nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \\n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \\nstudy. \\n     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \\n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \\nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \\nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \\n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \\nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \\nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \\nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \\nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \\nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \\nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \\nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \\nby p values of less than 0.05. \\n     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \\n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \\nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \\nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \\nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \\nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \\nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \\nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \\nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \\nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \\nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \\n(no-law states). \\n     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \\nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \\nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \\ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \\n43.2%, respectively). \\n     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \\nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \\nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \\nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \\n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \\nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \\nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \\nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \\nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \\ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). \\n     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \\nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \\nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \\nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \\nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \\n\\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \\nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \\nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \\nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \\nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \\nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \\nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). \\n     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \\nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \\nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \\neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \\nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \\nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \\ndirected at parents with young children. \\n     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \\naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \\nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \\nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \\nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \\nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \\nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \\nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \\nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

The \\nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \\nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \\nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. \\n     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \\nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \\nkidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general \\ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand \\nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \\nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \\ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. \\n     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \\ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \\nthe reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \\nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \\npool, or random variation. \\n     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \\ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \\nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \\nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Throughout the season increases in the indices \\nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \\nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \\nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \\nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \\n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \\nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \\nA(H1N1). \\n     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \\ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \\nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \\namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. \\n     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \\nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \\ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \\nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \\nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \\nAuthors: Louisa E.

Together, \\nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \\ntechnology (ART) procedures. \\n\\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or \\npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \\nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \\nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \\n\\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \\nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \\nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \\nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \\nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \\ntraditional therapies. \\n\\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \\nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \\nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \\n\\no in vitro \\no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \\n  transfer \\no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \\nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \\ntowards improved success of these technologies. \\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n                           Future Areas of Research\\n\\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \\nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \\ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \\ndisease. \\n\\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \\nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \\namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \\n\\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \\nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \\nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \\nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \\nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \\nsex-linked disorders. \\n\\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \\nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \\nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \\nof affected children. \\n\\n\\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\\nCollege of Medicine \\nUniversity of Arizona\\nTucson, Arizona\\n\\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for the\\n                           Management of Infertility\\n\\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \\nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \\n\\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \\nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \\nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \\nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \\nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \\nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \\nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \\nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \\nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \\nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \\nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \\nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \\nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \\negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \\nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \\nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  \\n     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \\ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male \\nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \\nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \\ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \\nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. \\n     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \\ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \\nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \\nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \\novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \\nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \\nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \\nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \\ntraditional therapies. \\n     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \\nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \\navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \\nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \\nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \\nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \\nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \\nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \\nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \\nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \\nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \\nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \\nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \\n\\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \\nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \\nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \\ntube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \\noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \\nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \\ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \\npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \\nand/or idiopathic infertility.    \\n     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \\nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \\nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \\npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \\nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \\nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \\nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \\npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \\na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \\ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \\nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \\nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. \\n     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \\nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \\nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \\ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. \\n     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \\nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \\nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \\nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \\nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \\nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \\nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \\nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. \\n     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \\nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \\nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in \\ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \\npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \\nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \\nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \\nthrough enzymatic digestion. \\n     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \\npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \\nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \\nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \\nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \\nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \\noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \\nestablish conception. \\n\\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\\nCollege of Medicine \\n--------- end of part 2 ------------\\n\",\n",

       " 'I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed.\\nSteve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci. \\nMed. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women \\nposter for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did \\nnot exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I \\nsee that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \\n\\nLet me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \\nno idea how the human body interacts with it\\'s environment and how that \\nbalance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians \\nwho dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go \\nfrom doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and \\nthen when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling \\nquack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn\\'t help Elaine or Jon\\nbut somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a \\nquack.  \\n\\nI\\'ve been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten \\nyears now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were \\nraised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their \\nfarm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to \\nentering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is \\nabout 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition \\neither tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That\\'s okay because I \\nknow that some of what I\\'m teaching is going to stick and there will be at \\nleast a few \"enlightened\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It\\'s really \\ntoo bad that most U.S. medical schools don\\'t cover nutrition because if \\nthey did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the \\nmedical profession.\\n\\nIn animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \"good\" bacteria after \\nantibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not \\nhave a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \"good\" bacteria is \\nneeded after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all \\nkinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small \\nand large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \\nnonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \\nsystem is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \\nthe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \\ntoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \\nthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \\nresidence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \\nhappen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\\nSteve got real upset with Elaine\\'s doctor because he was using anti-fungals \\nand vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \\nvitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \\nElaine\\'s doctor a quack.\\n\\nHere is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \\ncalled, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\\nfor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \\nyeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.\\nCandidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it \\nrequires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  \\n\\nCandida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of \\nnormal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing\\nfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral \\ncourse of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain \\nmuch higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in \\nit\\'s food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely \\nsurvives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \\nthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \\ndiabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little \\nbuggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but \\nsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \\nmembrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \\nthe candida or not isn\\'t certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on \\nthe skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \"treat\" it.\\nIf it\\'s internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \\nnondiscript.  \\n\\n\\nCandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \\nthe sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \\nvaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \\nususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \\nthey broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \\nresponse will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \\nfrom their diets.  About 30% of all American\\'s die with less Vitamin A than \\nthey were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \\nA does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \\nbarrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \\ninflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \\n\\nWhile diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \\nthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \\nknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \\ncompetition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \\navailable to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \\nuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \\nthe anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \\ninflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \\nantibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \\njust as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \\nvaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\\n\\nBut even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by \\nthe excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to \\nreturn after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of \\nthe problem is addressed(lack of a \"good\" bacterial flora in the body and/or \\npoor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective \\ntherapy for candida overgrowth.  From it\\'s name, it is an acid loving \\norganism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not \\ngrow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is \\nthe predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum \\nantibiotics).  \\n\\nIn the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \\nreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \\nfavorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \\nhumidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \\nminimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \\n\\nIf the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \\nblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \\nbloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \\noccurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \\nfor occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \\nplace.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \\nbut her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \\nhas told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \\nspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \\nfalse positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \\nbasis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it\\'s nice to know that I don\\'t have \\ncolon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \\ndoctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\\n\\nCandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria \\ntend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline \\nduring a woman\\'s period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. \\nVinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal \\nproblems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of \\nLactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of \\nthe purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina \\nproblem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year \\nuntil she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting \\nscripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had \\nthe same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some \\ndigging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she \\nused in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex \\nreturned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \\nGI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \\npatients is a non-existent syndrome.\\n\\nThe nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria \\nwhich is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  \\nIf taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \\naresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\\nBut before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \\nneeds to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and \\nsome of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans \\nare not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of \\nthe population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent \\ndisorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).\\n \\nSome of the above material was obtained from \"Natural Healing\" by Mark \\nBricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human \\nnutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in \\nthe future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely \\nimportant role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in \\nthe body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida \\nblooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate \\nintake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI \\nsystem is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it\\'s not going to out \\ngrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and \\nfatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check \\nonce carbohydrate is returned to the gut.\\n\\nIf Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, \\nfine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably \\naccosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor\\'s use of vitamin \\nA and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice \\nfrom newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our \\ntime and knowledge can slug it out to our heart\\'s content.  If you saved \\nyour venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly \\nseeking help alone, I wouldn\\'t have a problem with your behavior. \\n \\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\\n1111 West 17th St.\\nTulsa, Ok. 74107',\n",

In other words, the distance between the ellipse\\nand its offset is same everywhere.\\n\\nThis problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.\\nThe tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the\\npositions of the ball\\'s center. Is the offset of an ellipse still\\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\\nStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was\\nimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold\\ninternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!\\nHow many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most\\nimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?\\n\\nI was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year\\nto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this\\nproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)\\nis not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire\\nor half offset.

I am now wondering if I didn\\'t touch the base and make things\\ncomplicated. Please give me a hint.\\n\\nI know you may argue this is not a CG problem.

Digital immortality.\\n\\nThe basic idea behind \"digital immortality\" is that computer networks   \\nare here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them\\nwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they\\'ll be put in different\\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they\\'ll be\\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \\n \\nIf that doesn\\'t interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \\nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it\\'s stimulus, it will \\ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\\n \\nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \\nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own\\ncopies of the images to look at when you\\'ve got the gumption...\\nthat\\'s what they\\'re here for.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWHERE?             \\n\\nOTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  \\n \\n \\t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite \\n\\t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)\\n\\nMerely \"anonymous FTP\" to either site on Internet and change to the\\nappropriate directory.  Don\\'t forget to get busy and use the \"bin\"\\ncommand to make sure you\\'re in binary.\\n\\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\\nOTIStuff...\\n\\tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\\n\\tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\\n              \\nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \\nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\\nit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\\nare also welcome.\\n\\nOTIS\\' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \\nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \\nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \\nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\\ntougher to find.  If you can\\'t find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \\nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \\nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \\n\\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \\n\\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we\\'ll\\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \\ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \\nemailing).\\n\\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\\ncopies to:\\n\\nThe OTIS Project\\nc/o Ed Stastny\\nPO BX 241113\\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\\n\\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \\nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \\nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \\ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\\ndirectory where it\\'s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \\n \\nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\\ncontact me and we\\'ll arrange things.\\n\\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\\nThis is good for people who don\\'t have direct access to encoders or FTP,\\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\\nJPG.  If you can\\'t...we can convert from most formats...we\\'d just rather\\nnot have to.\\n\\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\\ncan stand.  Even if you don\\'t have stuff to contribute, you can send\\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \\nget a slab-o-OTIS.\\n\\nAs of 04/21/93, we\\'re at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \\nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISTRIBUTION?\\n\\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \\non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \\nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \\n \\nIt would also be nice if you\\'d send me a note when you did post images\\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\\n\\nIt\\'s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\\nkeen of you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUSE?\\n\\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\\nyou\\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \\nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \\nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \\nArtists name.  If permission isn\\'t explicitly given, then you\\'ll have \\nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\\'ll get in contact with the artist for \\nyou, or give you their contact information.\\n \\nWhen you DO use permitted work, it\\'s always courteous to let the artist\\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\\ncompensation for their files.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNAMING IMAGES?\\n\\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\\nlike:\\n \\n\\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\\n\\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\\nremain intact on all systems.  \\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\\n\\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\\ncase they\\'d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\\naddress or other information you\\'d like people to know.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHMMM?!\\n\\nThat\\'s about it for now.

OTIS\\n\\t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\\n\\t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \\n\\t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \\n\\t     electronically.  If you don\\'t want your images distributed     \\n\\t     all-over, don\\'t upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is\\n\\t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or\\n\\t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not \\n\\t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        \\n\\t     screen-printed clothing, etc).

She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like\\nthis before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the\\nfamily.

If you leave a file open on a\\nfloppy drive, then change the disk and do something which updates or closes\\nthat file, you have a good chance of getting part of the directory and FAT\\nfrom the other disk written to the new disk.

       " '\\nIt helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least\\na reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short\\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\\n\\n================================================================\\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\\n\\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\\n   Consider deleting these edges.\\n\\n1) Now, there are two goals:\\n\\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\\'s)\\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \\n       using the digitized (x,y)\\'s).\\n\\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.

       " \"Sorry I missed you Raymond, I was just out in Dahlgren last month...\\n\\nI'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I\\ncan help a little.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

       " \"\\nFlights of fancy, and other irrational approaches, are common.  The crucial\\nthing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use\\nunless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientists\\nwhose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit\\nout loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.\\n\\n(Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA\\nelectrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that\\nhe'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic\\ngenes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out\\nbinding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence\\nthat occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for\\nWarren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in\\nso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into\\nthe genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were\\nmuch elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was\\nrecognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.\\nOther species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me,\\nWarren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)\\n\\n\\nI'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism\\nfor generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really\\nworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense\\nof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best\\nthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong,\\nyou will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_.\\nIf you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all\\nin mind, you will probably get nowhere.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to\\nnon-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science:\\nLysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.\\n\\n\\nI don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at\\nwhich I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the\\nculture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing\\nprocess.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.\\n\\nAnother point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental\\ndesign''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,\\nnot design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for\\nbacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously\\nbeen found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny\\nnose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage\\nwas well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.\\n\\n\\nIt is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps\\nyou can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out\\nfor perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first\\nadvanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from\\nmodern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.\",\n",

Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\\n\\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\\nline/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\\n\\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\\nwhat it all means later on). \\n\\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\\n\\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions.

This has been\\nan ellusive matter for researchers, and is one of the fundamental requirements\\nfor many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease.\\nUp to now, only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to \"prove\" that\\nthe disease exists.\\n\\nThis paper is noteworthy in two other regards:\\n\\n1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogs\\nhad episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5\\nmonths after exposure.  After this period, none showed any further\\nclinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  So\\nthese are proven, clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous\\nrecovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course, observations\\nlonger than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn\\'t\\nhave the same chronicity that some see in humans.\\n\\n2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the\\nvaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.

       " \"I have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\\n\\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\\ntube qualities?\\n\\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\\n\\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \\nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\\n\\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\\n\\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\\n\\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

As soon as you possibly can.  The\\ndifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery\\nand a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety\\ndoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally,\\nany hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in\\nthese kinds of problems.  DON\\'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.\\n\\nThe remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from\\na wonderful report by New Zealand\\'s Department of Labour (Occupational\\nSafety and Health Service): \"Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and\\nRehabilitation: A Practitioner\\'s Guide\".\\n\\nFirst, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn\\'t have your hands):\\n(note: you\\'re likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)\\n\\n  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries\\n  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI\\n  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI\\n  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI\\n  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)\\n  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.\\n  Pronation: Turning the palm down.\\n  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.\\n  Supination: Turning the palm up.\\n  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.\\n  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.\\n  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.\\n  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.\\n  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.\\n  Abduction: Moving away from the body.\\n  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.\\n\\nNow then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse\\nconditions.  Local problems are what you\\'d expect: specific muscles,\\ntendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.\\nDiffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle\\ndiscomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of\\ntenderness in muscles, although they\\'re not necessarily \"the problem.\"\\n\\n--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here\\'s the theory.\\n\\nNormally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which\\npass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict\\nthe blood flow.  By the time you\\'re exerting 50% of your full power,\\nyou\\'re completely restricting your blood flow.\\n\\nWithout fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,\\nthen they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates\\nnasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.\\n\\nOnce one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the\\nload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes\\nthings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,\\nand the cycle continues.\\n\\nAnother by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from\\nyour nerves.  They need blood too.\\n\\nAnyway, when you\\'re typing too much, you\\'re never really giving a change\\nfor the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never\\nrelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor\\nergonomics, only make things worse.\\n\\n--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:\\n\\n(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute\\ninjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have\\nless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)\\n\\nTenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis\\noccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to\\ncause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath\\'s ability\\nto lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets\\ninflamed, and you\\'ve got your problem.\\n\\nTendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon\\ncan cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,\\nand can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more\\nswelling, and more pain.  \"Sub-acute\" tendonitis is more common, which entails\\na dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse\\nwith repetitive activity.\\n\\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your\\nfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include\\nfeeling \"pins and needles\", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.\\nCTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.\\n\\nAdverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as \\'neural tension\\', this is where\\nthe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly\\ncompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.\\nAMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS \\ndisorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy \\n(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).\\n\\nOthers: for just about every part of your body, there\\'s a fancy name for\\na way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS\\nconditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors\\nmisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you\\nmay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion\\nbefore somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).\\n\\n==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment\\n\\nThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce\\ntension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.\\nIf you\\'re under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out\\nthe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding\\nprinciple in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.\\nEVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every\\nthree minutes.  It\\'s also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,\\ncalm down, and relax.\\n\\nIf you can\\'t sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and\\nrelaxation are really a big deal.\\n\\nThere are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce\\ninflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad\\nposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen\\nyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture\\nand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold\\ncontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what\\'s best\\nfor you.\\n\\n--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was\\nwritten in the New Zealand book that I\\'m lifting it almost verbatim from\\nAppendix 10. -- dwallach]\\n\\n. Let your shoulders relax.\\n. Let your elbows swing free.\\n. Keep your wrists straight.\\n. Pull your chin in to look down - don\\'t flop your head forward.\\n. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.\\n. Try leaning back in the chair.\\n. Don\\'t slouch or slump forward.\\n. Alter your posture from time to time.\\n. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.\\n\\nSet the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There \\nshould be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,\\nand your thighs should not slope too much.\\n\\nNow, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable\\nto work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy\\nis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a\\nfootrest.\\n\\nNow, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space\\nbetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in\\nthe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this\\narea.\\n\\nIf you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning\\nback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.\\n\\n[Now, I diverge a little from the text]\\n\\nA good chair makes a big difference.  If you don\\'t like your chair, go\\nfind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,\\nback height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in\\nthe way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm\\nrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good\\nstore and play with all these chairs -- pick one that\\'s right for you.\\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend \"Just Chairs.\"  The\\nname says it all.\\n\\n--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:\\n\\nThere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some\\npeople, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you\\nshouldn\\'t be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your\\nkeyboard to be \"right there\".  If you drop your arms at your side and then\\nlift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands\\nwhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid\\npronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads\\nmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and\\nlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It\\'s\\noften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or\\ndeviated hands.\\n\\nSome argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly\\ndesigned.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.\\nCheck out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.\\n\\n==5== Requests for more info\\n\\nClearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive\\nis incomplete.  There\\'s always more information out there.  If you\\'d like\\nto submit something, please send me mail, and I\\'ll gladly throw it in.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be\\nwonderful!  I\\'d love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  I\\'d\\nlove somebody to make a list of doctors.  I\\'d love somebody to edit the\\nabove sections, looking for places where I\\'ve obviously goofed.\\n\\n==6== References\\n\\nI completely rewrote the information section here, using a wonderful\\nguide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health\\nService, a service of their Department of Labour.

These finer particles are considered hazardous because \\nthey are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of \\ncompliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10 \\nexceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.  \\n     In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at \\nlevels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30 \\nmicrogram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with \\nasthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.  \\n     The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory \\nDisease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung \\nAssociation\\'s medical section.  \\n     The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that \\nparticulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study \\nby Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles \\nmay be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.  \\nOther studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms \\nand bronchitis in children.  \\n     \"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\" \\nsays Dr. Schwartz.  \"But more and more research is showing that particles are \\nbad actors as well.\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate \\nair pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated \\npollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex \\nand varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nacid aerosols.  \\n     \"Researchers can\\'t Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects \\nof particulate air pollution,\" says Dr. Schwartz.  \"We have no way of \\nduplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  \" Consequently, most of what \\nis known about particulates has been learned through population-based research \\nlike the Seattle study.  \\n     Given that the EPA\\'s current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur \\ndioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any \\ntime soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with \\nasthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.\\n     \"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only \\ncover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that\\'s \\nrarely particulate matter,\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \"However, PM10 doesn\\'t have \\nto be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n               NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma\\n\\nThe National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on \\nDiagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in \\ndermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance \\ntechniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care \\nprofessionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological \\ncharacteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management, \\nand followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi \\nand their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in \\npreventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.

Within the program, there are four types \\nof cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily \\nin basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on \\nclinical research; \"comprehensive\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a \\nmultidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community \\noutreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer \\nprevention and control research. \\n \\nAlthough some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was \\nthe National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new \\ncancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage \\nof the act also dramatically transformed the centers\\' structure and broadened \\nthe scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and \\ncancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers\\' program grew \\nprogressively. \\n \\nIn 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today, \\nthere are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria \\nfor comprehensive status. \\n \\nTo attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an \\ninstitution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly \\nestablished in 1990, the eight criteria for \"comprehensiveness\" include the \\nrequirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in \\nseveral scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong \\nprogram of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings \\ninto clinical practice. \\n \\nMoreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly \\nbeyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also \\nreferred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting \\nthe infrastructure of a cancer center\\'s operations.  These criteria encompass \\nstrong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials, \\nsignificant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important \\noutreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of \\nsources. \\n \\nThe other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and \\ncapabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit \\nimportant new findings or address timely research questions. \\n \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 32\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nOf the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, 14 are of the basic science type.  \\nThese centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers \\nengage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators \\nand in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications \\nfrom new discoveries in the laboratory. \\n \\nClinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and \\nclinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently \\nincorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their \\noverall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today. \\n \\nFinally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely \\nstructured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and \\ncontrol research.  These centers interface with state and local public health \\ndepartments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention \\nand control techniques from their research findings to those institutions \\nresponsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.  \\nConsortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with \\ninstitutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community \\nhospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials. \\n \\nTogether, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward \\ncreating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through \\ninterdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the \\nlaboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice. \\n \\nComprehensive Cancer Centers (Internet addresses are given where available) \\n \\nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center\\nBasic Health Sciences Building, Room 108\\n1918 University Boulevard\\nBirmingham, Alabama 35294\\n(205) 934-6612\\n \\nUniversity of Arizona Cancer Center\\n1501 North Campbell Avenue\\nTucson, Arizona 85724\\n(602) 626-6372\\nInternet:  syd@azcc.arizona.edu\\n \\nJonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center\\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles\\n200 Medical Plaza\\nLos Angeles, California 90027\\n(213) 206-0278\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 33\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nInternet:  rick@jccc.medsch.ucla.edu\\n \\nKenneth T.

The \\ndecision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to \\ntest a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of \\nHealth, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and  \\nHuman Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the \\ntherapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies \\nincluding Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH \\nthat they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is \\nintended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the  \\nreplication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week\\'s \\nreports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army\\'s test of the \\nMicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.  \\n\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the \\nnext 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\" said Shalala.   \\nAdministration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine \\nHealy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had \\nconvinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested \\nsimultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of \\nmultiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two \\nyears.\\n\\n==================================================================    \\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n\"The Limits of AZT\\'s Impact on HIV\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol. \\n114, No. 14, P. 18 \\n\\n     AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was \\napproved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.

However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that \\nalthough HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk \\nof  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit  \\ndisappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of \\nthe three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the \\ndrug\\'s cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S. \\nresearchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials, \\nmany argue the European  researchers\\' suggestion that HIV-positive patients \\nexperience  little improvement in their illness before the development of  \\nAIDS symptoms.

For the first 6 months, the women each day ate\\n8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second \\n6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the    \\nwomen each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection \\nwere significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.   \\n  The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.  \\nIt is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The   \\nresearchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some    \\nbrands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus         \\nthermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used  \\nin commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a         \\nprotective effect against Candida albicans, however.

The article states that research\\nhas shown that the oil has no discernable effect on the progression of the\\ndisease in patients in which demyelination has begun.  In patients with\\nAMN (a less acute form of the same disease) there is some improvement\\nseen in the ability of nerve fibres to conduct impulses.  In ALD patients\\nwho have not yet begun demyelination, the jury is still out.',\n",
       " 'Visual Numerics Inc. (formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in the\\nprocess of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0 \\nand C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent\\nGraphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through \\nJune 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with \\nansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge \\ntape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products.\\n \\nX Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts:\\n \\n1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types\\n   available through a large collection of X resources.\\n2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers.\\n3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization.\\n4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback.\\n5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget \\n   library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar \\n   to X programmers.\\n6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge\\'s UIM/X product.\\n   This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical\\n   layout of an application.\\n \\nC Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts:\\n \\n1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library\\n   is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C\\n   standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C.\\n2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse \\n   interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control\\n   with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization.\\n3. Large collection of high-level application functions for \"two-call\"\\n   graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available\\n   with minimal programming effort.\\n4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling\\n   the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot\\n   the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can \\n   control the event loop.\\n \\nIf anyone is interested in beta testing either of the products, please\\ncontact Wendy Hou at Visual Numerics via email at hou@imsl.com or call\\n713-279-1066.\\n \\n \\n-- \\nJaclyn Brandt\\njbrandt@NeoSoft.com',\n",

       " '\\n[...]\\n\\n   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION\\n   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What\\n   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.\\n\\n   [Reproduced without permission]\\n\\n\\t   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,\\n\\twhere a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under\\n\\tthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,\\n\\tpresumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if\\n\\ta person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group\\n\\tof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and\\n\\tsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after\\n\\tdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage.\\n\\t   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a\\n\\tgood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.\\n\\tHowever, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers\\n\\tdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did\\n\\tactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not\\n\\tnecessarily go hand in hand.\\n\\t   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining\\n\\tthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.\\n\\tAnd after reviewing every one of them, the director of the\\n\\tLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins\\n\\tUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-\\n\\tsweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in\\n\\tthe amount of food eaten afterward.\\n\\n\\t   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing\\n\\tcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a\\n\\thost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government\\n\\thas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing\\n\\teverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.\\n\\tStill, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and\\n\\tafter the sweetener\\'s entering the market have failed to confirm\\n\\tthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That\\'s why the\\n\\tCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged with\\n\\tmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association\\'s\\n\\tCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration\\n\\thave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a\\n\\tclean bill of health.\\n\\t   Granted, the FDA has set forth an \"acceptable daily intake\" of\\n\\t50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed\\n\\tthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take\\n\\tin 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of\\n\\taspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,\\n\\tor 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...\\n\\tA 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams\\n\\tof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups\\n\\tof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content\\n\\tof selected foods omitted]\\n\\t   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away\\n\\tfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called\\n\\tphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000\\n\\tto 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential\\n\\tamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child\\n\\tconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause\\n\\tsuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with\\n\\tPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other\\n\\taspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \"Phenylketonurics:\\n\\tContains Phenylalanine.\"\\n',\n",

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nJohn Bradley\\'s free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,\\nGIF, and other image formats.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\\nor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called \\'xv-???.tar.Z\\' (where ??? is the\\nversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the \\'contrib\\' directory on\\nexport or the \\'pub/xv\\' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits\\ninternally, which means it\\'s not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit\\ndisplay (you\\'ll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn\\'t use XV to\\nconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they\\'ll get color-quantized first.\\nBut XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.\\nCAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check\\nthe \"save at normal size\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will\\nbe blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip\\n    PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nI have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,\\nbut surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n',\n",

If you\\'re feeling\\ncreative, and your favorite number hasn\\'t been taken already, you can\\nmake a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-\\nbase-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not\\nthat you won\\'t get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)\\n\\nOh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You\\'ll\\njust be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole\\nnet, and you\\'ll look like a clueless newbie too.\\n\\nBy now you\\'re probably asking \"So who\\'s the KotL already?\". Well, as\\nJohn Sloan notes below, that\\'s about the only real \"secret\" left around\\nhere, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,\\nnor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was\\nthe original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the\\nKotL\\'s first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely\\nwith hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-\\noriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting\\nmessages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with \"weenie\\nmailers\"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a\\nDead-Head.\\n\\n***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************\\n\\nOnce you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically\\ngroveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed\\nwork for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting\\nsomething done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)\\ndays, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of\\neconomic activity on the part of the KotL\\'s employers, sending yet\\nanother copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it\\njust makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an\\nexcersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least\\nannotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request\\nwas submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think\\nthe KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).\\n\\n***********************************************************************\\n\\nOne more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren\\'t what\\nthey used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?\\nThe typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &\\ne-mail address. For example:\\n\\n0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM\\n\\n(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only\\nrequirements for DoD membership, that\\'s not strictly true these days, as\\nthere are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)\\n\\nBlaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n            \"Denizens of Doom\", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)\\n\\n      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce\\'s permission]\\n\\nThere is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal \\nthings that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  \\nmotorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  \\nhelmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve\\nseats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, \\ntraffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double \\nentendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They \\nargue with each other and plan rides together.\\n\\nThe difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, \\nalthough they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each \\nother face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world \\nand communicate with each other electronically via computer.\\n\\nThe computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  \\nthe people range from college and university students to high-tech industry \\nprofessionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, \\nrec.motorcycles (pronounced \"wreck-dot-motorcycles,\" it\\'s the file name for \\nthe group\\'s primary on-line \"meeting place\") carries about 2250 articles per \\nmonth;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent \\nposters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred \\nto as the DoD.\\n\\nThe DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of \\nparodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer \\nenthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \"Denizen \\nof Doom.\"  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of \\nthe Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of \\ncourse, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.\\n\\nThe idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules \\nappealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the \\nList, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been \\nalmost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and \\nCanada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, \\nGermany, Norway and Finland.\\n\\nKeeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run \\nof 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the \\nAmerican Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- \\nselling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a \\nfew months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were \\ndonated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 \\nto the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs \\nin the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.\\n\\nAs often as possible, the DoD\\'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go \\nriding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of \\nDoD\\'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California\\'s \\n\"Silicon Valley.\"  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on \\nRollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California \\n\"Joust.\"\\n\\nThe Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big \\nbarbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern \\nCalifornia ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, \\nmeeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan \\nfor 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction \\nwith the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.\\n\\nThough it\\'s a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective \\ncommunications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional \\nmotorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in \\nsearch of two-wheeled camaraderie, it\\'s a great way for kindred spirits to \\nget together.  Long may they flame.\\n\\n\\n\"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live\"\\t[centerbar]\\n\\nThis official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which \\nyou can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do \\nanything like that face to face.  These insults are known as \"flames\";  \\nissuing them is called \"flaming.\"  Flames often start when a member \\ndisagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A \\ntypical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be \\nsomething like:  \"What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad \\nposeur!\"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense \\nof the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding \\nability and your cat.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_\\n\\n                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011\\n\\nPeriodically the question \"What is DoD?\" is raised. This is one of\\nthose questions in the same class as \"Why is the sky blue?\", \"If there\\nis a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?\" and \"Why do\\nwomen inevitably tell you that you\\'re such a nice guy just before they\\ndump you?\", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,\\nand philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion\\nby philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the\\nhalls of academe for generations. \\n\\nA long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few\\nminutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on\\na computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two\\nmachines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another\\nvia a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but\\nwho was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of\\nthe various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and\\nsigned it \"The Denizen of Doom\". Not wishing to identify himself, he\\nasked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time\\nbecome DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit\\nabout what other people thought and generally being a right thinking\\nindividual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. \\n\\nHe who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was\\nthe funniest thing he\\'d seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty\\neasily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom\\nMotorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership\\nnumber. \\n\\nPerhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a\\nmotorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or\\nmake or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized\\nelectronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a\\npart of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a\\ngestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the\\nsum of its parts.  It could also be that we\\'re all computer nerds who\\nwear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen\\nto also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight\\nratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open\\nminded enough to accept us as members. \\n\\nIn a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom\\nMotorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have\\nnever met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet\\nfeel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some\\nof the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized\\nand run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the\\nnetwork via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list\\n(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the\\nsame region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating\\naround the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by\\n#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and\\ndistributed on VHS by #18)! \\n\\nWhere will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,\\nplacing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine\\nmanagement computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each\\nparticipant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?\\nWill the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal\\nroom and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. \\n\\nThe DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net\\naccess and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only\\nask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few\\nreally good club secrets). New members will receive via email a\\nmembership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which\\nincludes name, state, and email address. \\n\\nThe Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least\\nuntil next year when we may decided to change the name). \\n\\n                  Live to Flame - Flame to Live\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n     The DoD daemon as seen on the patches, pins, etc. by\\n\\n\\tChuck Rogers,  car377@druhi.att.com,  DoD #0003\\n \\n\\n                :-(           DoD            )-: \\n               :-(  x    __         __    x   )-:      \\n              :-(  x    / /         \\\\ \\\\    x   )-:     \\n             :-(  x    / / -\\\\-----/- \\\\ \\\\    x   )-:    \\n            :-(  L     | \\\\/  \\\\   /  \\\\/ |     F   )-:   \\n            :-(  I     | /    \\\\ /    \\\\ |     L   )-:   \\n            :-(  V     \\\\/ __   /   __ \\\\/     A   )-:   \\n            :-(  E     / /  \\\\     /  \\\\ \\\\     M   )-:   \\n            :-(        | |   \\\\   /   | |     E   )-:   \\n            :-(  T     | | . | _ | . | |         )-:   \\n            :-(  O     | \\\\___// \\\\\\\\___/ |     T   )-:   \\n            :-(         \\\\     \\\\_/     /      O   )-:   \\n            :-(  F       \\\\___     ___/           )-:   \\n            :-(  L        \\\\ \\\\     / /        L   )-:   \\n            :-(  A         \\\\ vvvvv /         I   )-:   \\n            :-(  M         | (   ) |         V   )-:   \\n            :-(  E         | ^^^^^ |         E   )-:   \\n             :-(  x        \\\\_______/        x   )-:    \\n              :-(  x                       x   )-:     \\n               :-(  x   rec.motorcycles   x   )-:\\n                :-(          USENET          )-:\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                      The DoD\\n\\n              by the Denizen of Doom    DoD #1\\n \\nWelcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of\\nall time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples?

And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.\\n\\nSometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: \"What does DoD\\nstand for? It\\'s not the Department of Defense is it?\" Naturally, a\\nDenizen who had watched the movie \"Top Gun\" a few times too many rose\\nto the occasion and replied:\\n\\n\"That\\'s classified, we could tell you, but then we\\'d have to kill you.\"\\n\\nAnd the rest is history.\\n\\nA variation on the \"security\" theme is to supply disinformation about\\nwhat DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where\\nknown) include:\\n\\nDaughters of Democracy (DoD 23)\\t\\tDoers of Donuts\\nDancers of Despair (DoD 9)\\t\\tDebasers of Daughters\\nDickweeds of Denver\\t\\t\\tDriveway of Death\\nDebauchers of Donuts\\t\\t\\tDumpers of Dirtbikes\\n\\nNote that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be\\nlimited only by the contents of one\\'s imagination or dictionary file.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                     The rec.moto.photo archive\\n\\nFirst a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck\\nRogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,\\nand several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in\\nunknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate\\nfor an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not\\nonly provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken\\nthe time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.\\n\\nNot only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk\\nat their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the\\nserver too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,\\nthe general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.\\n\\nHere are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how\\nto use the archive.\\n\\n**********************************************************\\n\\nVia ftp:\\n\\ncerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]\\n\\nVia e-mail:\\n\\nThe address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the\\nmessage.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The\\narguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For\\nrec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:\\n\\ndir [dod]\\nsend [dod]bruce_tanner.gif\\nsend [dod]dodframe.ps\\n\\nand you\\'ll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts\\nof bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.\\n\\nOh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to\\nthe next whole file) are send.  A \\'send [dod]*.gif\\' would send 150 files of\\n50K each; not a good idea.\\n-- \\nBruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU\\nCerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner\\n\\n**********************************************************\\n\\nA couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so\\nwhy not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?\\nSecond, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind\\nof you to access it after normal working hours (California time). \\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                      Patches? What patches?\\n\\nYou may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &\\npins. And your reaction was probably: \"I want!\", or \"That\\'s sick!\", or\\nperhaps \"That\\'s sick! I want!\"\\n\\nWell, there\\'s some good news and some bad news. The good news is that\\nthere\\'s been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad\\nnews is that there isn\\'t anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn\\'t\\nbecause of any \"exclusivity\" attempt, but simply because there is no\\n\"DoD store\" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by\\nindividual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is\\nsomeone says \"I\\'m thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they\\'ll cost\\n$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?\" Then\\norders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the\\npre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a\\nDoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or\\nproduce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all\\nthis is anarchy in action.\\n\\nHere\\'s a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and\\nperpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),\\nmotorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts\\n(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and\\npatches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by\\npopular demand].\\n\\nAll \"profits\" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association\\nMotorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been\\ncontributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,\\nyou\\'ll see a large plaque on the Founders\\' Wall in the name of \"Denizens\\nof Doom, USENET, The World\", complete with a DoD pin.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHere\\'s a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.\\n\\n~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles\\n~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>\\n~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum\\n~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT\\n\\nI received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,\\nthe other day.\\n\\n\"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:\\n\\nCongratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the\\nDenizens of Doom!

Rides:\\n\\nSummer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third\\nyear, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass\\ntrip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got\\ntogether for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north\\nas NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of\\nNorth Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great\\nPacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for\\nriding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have\\ncome to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]\\n\\nAlso worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the\\nMoab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,\\nriding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal\\n2-strokes.  And though it\\'s not an \"official\" (as if anything could be\\nofficial with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races\\nin Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters\\nto gather.

Reproduced without permission.]\\n\\n\\n\\nDigression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors\\n\\nAlthough the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practically\\ntasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle\\nberries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in\\nsuch a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile, \\nMoskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle\\nberry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids \\n(which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste\\nsour as well.\\n\\nMiraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a\\ndiet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin\\npill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such\\nsubstances would taste sweet without providing many calories.\\n\\nA colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries.\\nWe drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasted\\nextremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We \\nawoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.\\n\\n[... continued discussion of a couple other taste-altering substances ...]\\n\\n\\nRefs:  \\n\\nBartoshuk, L.M., Gentile, R.L., Moskowitz, H.R., & Meiselman, H.L.

I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in\\nthe blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are\\nsodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else,\\none can get too much of a good thing.\\n\\n\\nAgain, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased\\nheart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries,\\nessentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency\\nher, necessarily.\\n\\n\\n\\nWell stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not\\nnecessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting\\noccurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has\\neaten. If a person can\\'t digest the stuff (entirely possible - the\\nlist of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an\\nenzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly\\nache) would be expected.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar\\nto vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious\\ncompounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible\\nsome other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the\\nsymptoms. But it\\'s important to remember that a lot opf these effets\\ncan be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be\\nnecessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person\\nwas exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration\\nand heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from\\nsimple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.\\n \\n\\nPeople respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends\\nupon what it is about the compound that \"pisses off\" their body.\\nPollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many\\npeople, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an\\nhistamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard,\\ncausing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an\\nallergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that\\ncontain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can\\nperturb that person\\'s system as much as inhaling it. \\n\\n\\nSee above. And don\\'t think that heart rate changes, and circulatory\\nproblems are not serious. They can be deadly.\\n\\nand brain damage. \\n\\nThe area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system\\ncontrolling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling\\nthe cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin,\\nand other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.\\n\\n\\npoisoning. \\n\\nAbsolutely.
